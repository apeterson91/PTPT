<h1>About the Pittsburgh Transit Propensity Tool</h1>
<p>This site hosts and documents the Pittsburgh Transit Propensity Tool (PTPT), a work that is inspired by and adapted from the <a href="https://www.pct.bike/">Propensity to Cycle Tool</a> <span class="citation">(Lovelace et al. 2017)</span>. It is licensed under an MIT license: it is free to use, copy and modify. Please cite this blog post and arxiv citation if you use the PTPT in your work.</p>

<h2>Aim and Scope of the PTPT</h2>
<p>The PTPT was designed to assist bike advocates, transport planners, and policy makers in the prioritization of advocacy, education, investments and infrastructure to reduce car dependency in the city of Pittsburgh. Car dependency here understood to mean, that a citizen <em>has</em> to have a car in order to have a reasonable expectation of fulfilling their basic needs: getting their groceries, going to work and participating in social activities. The PTPT answers the question “How and where do people travel across Pittsburgh for these activities and where are the greatest opportunities to introduce new multi-modal transit interventions?” It is intended to supplement and inform the work outlined in Pittsburgh’s <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan">bike+</a> plan and inspire even more transformational ideas about how to empower individuals to move around their city safely, economically and quickly.</p>
