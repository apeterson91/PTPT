# About the Pittsburgh Transit Propensity Tool

<img src="hex.jpg" alt="PTPT" width=120, height=100 style="vertical-align:middle">

This site hosts and documents the Pittsburgh Transit Propensity Tool (PTPT), 
a work that is inspired by and adapted from the 
[Propensity to Cycle Tool](https://www.pct.bike/) [@lovelace2017propensity].
It is licensed under an MIT license: it is free to 
use, copy and modify. 


## Aim and Scope of the PTPT

The PTPT was designed to assist bike advocates, transport planners, and
policy makers in the prioritization of advocacy, education, investments and 
infrastructure to reduce car dependency in the city of Pittsburgh. Car 
dependency here understood to mean, that a resident would be greatly 
inconvenienced in their daily life by not having a car in order
to have a reasonable expectation of fulfilling their basic needs: 
getting their groceries, going to work and participating in social activities. 
The PTPT answers the question "How and where do people travel across 
Pittsburgh for these activities and where are the greatest opportunities to
introduce new multi-modal transit interventions?" It is intended to supplement 
and inform the work outlined in Pittsburgh's 
[bike+](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan) plan [@lucas_2020] and inspire 
further transformational ideas about how to empower individuals to move 
around their city safely, economically, sustainably and quickly. Previous 
sources of data in this area include the 
[American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting.html) and the 
[makemytripcount](https://www.makemytripcount.org/) survey, though neither 
capture the level of granularity in purpose and destination that this work does.

You can see the source code for this project on 
[github](www.github.com/apeterson91/ptpt) and read more 
about the technical ideas behind this work in the Methods tab or
