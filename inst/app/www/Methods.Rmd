# Overview 

The methodology underlying the PTPT falls under two headings (1) Data Collection
and (2) Substantive Questions. Data collection is laid out in three stages with 
increasing difficulty and correspondingly higher quality data 
associated with each successive stage. Methods for investigating substantive 
questions develop in parallel to Data Collection; models and estimates 
discussed under this heading should be available 
with minor adjustment for each of the three data stages. 
These methods are understood to be open ended and falling under two headings: 
(1) Descriptive and (2) Prescriptive. That is, methods are developed with the 
intent to describe the current state of transit use in Pittsburgh, as well as to 
"prescribe" in decision theoretic terms, what actions (interventions, 
programs, etc.) may lead to a greater uptake in one mode of transit over 
another.


# Data Collection 

Before explaining the strategy behind each stage of data collection we introduce
notation so that the technical reader can identify consistent terms 
across all stages of data collection and methods.

Consider the $i$th PGH resident, $(i=1,...,N)$ who performs each of $K$ trips 
on a regular basis, say a typical week. We assume, to start, that the mode of 
transit is fixed per trip - a person **only** walks (for example) to the 
grocery store. The mode of transit for the $i$th resident is denoted as $m_i$,
where $m_i \in \{1,...,M}$ and $M$ is the total possible modes of transit. 
This resident may also have certain characteristics, such as race, income, etc.
that may be relevant to understanding their mode choice. We denote the 
vector of these $p$ characteristics as $Z_i \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$.

With this preliminary notation aside, we now describe how these data are 
collected or generated in each of the three stages constituting the PTPT's 
development.

## Stage 1: Simulated Data {.tabset}

### Big Picture

The first stage of data "collection" for the PTPT is using simulated data. 
There are several reasons for this. To begin with, simulating data is cheap and 
quick while still providing some semblance of realism. Indeed, using the wealth
of data sources available through the [WPRDC](http://www.wprdc.org/) as well
as American Community Survey data available through the census, open source
data available through [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), 
elevation data provided by NASA, and more, simulated data offer us the chance
to quickly summon various scenarios of how transit behavior may vary amongst
Pittsburgh residents. To this end, we sample 100 fictitious residents across
the 88 neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, assign them a random residential parcel
and generate three trips (grocery, commute and social) by three modes of transit
(walking, biking and driving a personal vehicle). From these we then generate 
a mode of transit using a discrete choice model. See the Technical Tab for 
further details.

Further work in generating data will incorporate further modes of transit, and 
hypothetical modes of data collection that account for shared household trips, 
e.g. two subject participants make two different commute trips, but one shared
grocery trip. These two will be of primary focus to better reflect both the
transit reality of Pittsburghers as well as the likely reality of future data 
collection - clustered sampling - to which we now turn in greater detail
in the next section.
