# What kinds of information are you asking for?

In order to understand how and where the residents of Pittsburgh
use different modes of transit we'll be asking you for information about
the following:

1. Basic demographics like Age, Sex, and Race
2. Car, Bike, and Bus pass ownership 
3. Bike and Bus facility/route familiarity

We'll also ask you about different kinds of trips that you take within
Pittsburgh to (i) commute to work, (ii) drop kids off at school, 
(iii) pickup groceries and (iv) attend "social" activities.

Given concerns over data privacy, we allow for survey respondents to 
either tell us what neighborhoods they travel to/from, or, for more 
useful and exact inference, the streets they use to travel to/from their 
destinations. For the latter case we encourage respondents **not** to 
include the street they reside on, but the nearest cross street to their 
residence.

# How will the data be used?

The data will be used to further the mission of BikePGH and the city of 
Pittsburgh in creating an urban environment in which city residents can 
thrive without the need of a car. If you'd like further details please 
see the About, Methods and Analysis Tabs.

# Are you selling my data?

No. This is a completely non-profit venture. The only "green" we want to see
more of is in bike lanes and city trees.

# How are my data stored?

Discussions are ongoing.
